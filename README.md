# Structural GoF Design Patterns for Java

In this repository will be introduce the structural gof designs patterns for Java. The patterns are:
- Adapter - Allow us to wrap an incompatible object in an adapter to make it compatible with another class. <b>Usage examples</b>: When it is necessary to adapt an object that is incompatible to use.
- Bridge - Change the service provider without impacts in your service. <b>Usage examples</b>: When it is necessary to separate the abstract service from its implementation.
- Composite - A group of objects should be treated the same way as a single instance. <b>Usage examples</b>: When there is an object designed to consist of one or more similar objects, all show a similar feature
- Decorator - Allow us add a behavior to a object, without to affect the behavior de anothers object in same class. <b>Usage examples</b>:
When you need to add a feature to object without to affect the decorated class.
- Facade - Provides a simplified interface(facade) for the client to access the system. The fa√ßade conceals components and complex logic. <b>Usage examples</b>: When there is a complex system or service to clients need to use, a facade can make integration easier.
- Flyweight - 
- Proxy
