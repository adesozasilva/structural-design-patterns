# Structural GoF Design Patterns for Java

In this repository will be introduce the structural gof designs patterns for Java. The patterns are:
- Adapter - Allow us to wrap an incompatible object in an adapter to make it compatible with another class. When to use? When it is necessary to adapt an object that is incompatible to use.
- Bridge - Change the service provider without impacts in your service. When to use? When it is necessary to separate the abstract service from its implementation.
- Composite - A group of objects should be treated the same way as a single instance. When to use? When there is an object designed to consist of one or more similar objects, all show a similar feature
- Decorator - Allow us add a behavior to a object, without to affect the behavior de anothers object in same class.
- Facade
- Flyweight
- Proxy
