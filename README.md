# Structural GoF Design Patterns for Java

In this repository will be introduce the structural gof designs patterns for Java. The patterns are:

- Adapter - Allow you wrap an incompatible object in an adapter to make it compatible with another class. <b>Usage examples</b>: When it is necessary to adapt an object that is incompatible with our system.

- Bridge - Change the service provider without impacts in your service. <b>Usage examples</b>: When it is necessary to separate the abstract service from its implementation.

- Composite - A group of objects should be treated the same way as a single instance. <b>Usage examples</b>: When there is an object designed to consist of one or more similar objects, all show a similar feature

- Decorator - Allow you add a behavior to a object, without to affect the behavior de anothers object in same class. <b>Usage examples</b>:
When you need to add a feature to object without to affect the decorated class.

- Facade - Provides a simplified interface(facade) for the client to access the system. The facade conceals components and complex logic. <b>Usage examples</b>: When there is a complex system or service to clients need to use, a facade can make integration easier.

- Flyweight - Create the objects and share the instances in the application. <b>Usage examples</b>: When you need to create a large number of immutable objects improving application memory consumption.

- Proxy - It is called by the client to access the service of an object. <b>Usage examples</b>: when you want to add some additional behaviors to an object of some existing class without changing the client code.
